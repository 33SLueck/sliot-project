# Secure Automation Platform - Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

**Challenge:** Design and implement an enterprise-grade automation platform with comprehensive security controls while maintaining cost-effectiveness within AWS free tier constraints.

**Solution:** Multi-layer security architecture achieving 78/100 security score with $0 monthly infrastructure cost.

**Impact:** Production-ready OAuth automation platform with enterprise security patterns, demonstrating sophisticated security engineering within real-world budget constraints.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS EC2 (Free Tier)
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose multi-service architecture
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx with advanced security configuration
- **Automation Platform:** n8n with PostgreSQL backend
- **SSL/TLS:** Let's Encrypt with automatic renewal
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Parameter Store with encryption
- **Frontend:** Next.js with production optimization

### Security Implementation

#### Network Security (95/100)
```
✅ Zero-trust network architecture
✅ All services bound to localhost (127.0.0.1)
✅ Only ports 80/443 exposed to internet
✅ Reverse proxy isolation preventing direct service access
✅ Network segmentation via Docker networking
```

#### Transport Security (95/100)
```
✅ Modern TLS implementation (1.2/1.3)
✅ HTTP/2 support with automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirect
✅ Let's Encrypt integration with automated certificate renewal
✅ Secure cipher suites and protocols
✅ HSTS and secure cookie configuration
```

#### Content Security (90/100)
```
✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) preventing XSS attacks
✅ Blocked external analytics and telemetry (RudderStack, PostHog)
✅ Removed unsafe-eval from script sources
✅ Comprehensive security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
✅ OAuth whitelisting for legitimate integrations
```

#### Authentication & Authorization (85/100)
```
✅ Dual authentication layers (Nginx Basic Auth + n8n internal)
✅ AWS Parameter Store integration for credential management
✅ Encrypted credential storage with access controls
✅ Rate limiting for brute force protection
✅ OAuth-ready callback configuration
```

#### Secrets Management (70/100)
```
✅ AWS Parameter Store with encryption at rest
✅ No hardcoded credentials in configuration files
✅ Secure credential rotation capability
⚠️ Container-level credential optimization (planned enhancement)
```
