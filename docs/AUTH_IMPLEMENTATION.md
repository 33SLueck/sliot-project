# AWS Cognito Authentication Setup - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What We've Built

✅ **Complete Cognito Authentication System**
- Hosted UI integration with NextAuth.js
- User creation in database on first login
- Clean authentication header with login/logout
- Development and production environment support

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get This Working

### 1. Create AWS Cognito User Pool

Go to AWS Console and follow the detailed guide in `/docs/COGNITO_SETUP.md`

Key settings for your User Pool:
- **User Pool Name**: `sliot-cms-users`
- **Domain**: `sliot-cms-auth` (or your choice)
- **Callback URLs**: 
  - Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/cognito`
  - Production: `https://sliot.de/api/auth/callback/cognito`

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Copy the template and fill in your Cognito values:

```bash
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
```

Then edit `frontend/.env.local` with your actual Cognito values:
- `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` 
- `COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `COGNITO_ISSUER`

### 3. Test the Authentication Flow

```bash
# Start the CMS backend
docker-compose up -d cms

# Start the frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and:
1. Click "Sign In" or "Register" 
2. You'll be redirected to AWS Cognito Hosted UI
3. After login, you'll be redirected back to your app
4. A user record will be automatically created in your database

## 🔧 How It Works

### Authentication Flow
```
User clicks "Sign In" 
↓
Redirects to AWS Cognito Hosted UI
↓
User logs in/registers on AWS page
↓ 
AWS redirects back with auth code
↓
NextAuth exchanges code for tokens
↓
Your app gets user info
↓
Creates user record in database (if new)
↓
User is logged in to your CMS
```

### File Structure Created

```

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Clean Header**: Shows login/register buttons when logged out
- **User Info**: Displays user name/email when logged in  
- **Sign Out**: One-click logout functionality
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

## 🔒 Security Features

- **AWS Managed Auth**: Cognito handles all security best practices
- **Encrypted Tokens**: JWT tokens are properly validated
- **CSRF Protection**: NextAuth includes CSRF protection
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate configs for dev/prod

## 🌍 Development vs Production

**Development** (`localhost:3000`):
- Uses local environment variables
- Cognito redirects to localhost
- Direct CMS API calls

**Production** (`sliot.de`):
- Environment variables from AWS Parameter Store or container
- Cognito redirects to production domain
- Internal Docker network for CMS API

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] AWS Cognito User Pool created
- [ ] Environment variables configured  
- [ ] Can click "Sign In" and redirect to Cognito
- [ ] Can register new account on Cognito
- [ ] Successfully redirected back after login
- [ ] User record created in database
- [ ] User info displayed in header
- [ ] Can sign out successfully

## 📝 Customization Options

Want to customize further? You can:
- Style the AuthHeader component
- Add user roles and permissions
- Implement protected routes
- Add user profile management
- Customize Cognito hosted UI (CSS)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you get errors:
1. **Check environment variables** in `.env.local`
2. **Verify Cognito callback URLs** match exactly
3. **Check CMS is running** on port 4000
4. **View browser network tab** for API call errors
5. **Check Docker logs** for backend issues
